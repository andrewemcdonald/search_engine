Blending with starter code: 5/5


Robustness and error checking: 3/5
(-1) LLMakeIterator can return null if malloc fails as well. Findkey doesn't check this, and much of your code resultantly relies on the malloc() in LLMakeIterator not failing.
(-1) Removing + adding a node instead of replacing value in-place in InsertHashTable when the key already exists.

Comments and other style issues: 5/5
(-0) Unecessary malloc when using LLIteratorGetPayload. Just allocate a local struct on the stack and pass in the address to it.

Extra credit: 0/5
